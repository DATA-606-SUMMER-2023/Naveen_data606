Abstract:

People are cautious while attempting to purchase a new home using their budgets and market methods.

The purpose of this study is to anticipate consistent house prices for non-houses holders depending on

their financial preparations and their objectives. By examining the preceding products, fare ranges, and

also Forecasted prices will be predicted to forewarn developments. The Predictions are made utilising

several Regression approaches in this study. For example, multiple linear, ridge, LASSO, elastic net, and

gradient Boost Regression and boosting House price forecast. All of the aforementioned tools were used

to create the data set strategies to determine which one is the greatest. The goal of this study is to assist

sellers in accurately estimating the selling price of a property and to assist individuals in predicting the

precise time slap to accumulate a house. Physical conditions, idea, and location, among other things, were

taken into account as cost-influencing elements.

Introduction:

This article refers together with latest Forecast on Research predictions considering trends to further plan

their economics. The main motivation of the project FORECASTING VARIATIONS ON HOUSE PRICE

was to make the best possible prediction of house prices by using appropriate algorithms and finding out

which among them is best suitable for predicting the price with low error rate. This is an interesting

problem because most of the people will eventually buy/sell a home. This problem allows us, as house

price analysts, to learn more about the housing market and helps with making more informed decisions.

The analysis that were done in this paper is mainly based on the dataset of Bangalore, KA. because of

unexpected changes in price of houses in and around Bangalore due to emergence. In this paper ,we try to

demonstrate all the possible Regression techniques which are suitable to our problem.

Problem Statement:

The aim of this project is to develop a reliable real estate price prediction model that can accurately

estimate property prices based on various features. The dataset contains historical data of real estate

properties, including information such as location, size, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and other

relevant attributes. You are required to build a linear regression model using the Scikit-learn

(sklearn)library in Python and implement data science principles like outlier removal and feature

engineering to improve the model's predictive performance.

Objective:

Our aim is to predict the price of houses located in a area by using the regression models. Aim is to

accurate are the real estate price predictions provided by the developed model compared to the actual

market prices, and what is the overall performance evaluation of the model in terms of mean squared error

or R-squared value. The real estate price prediction website handle a high volume of concurrent user

requests, and what is the average response time for serving predictions.vHow efficiently does the model

perform with dimensionality reduction techniques, balancing predictive power and computational

complexity? Used hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV in improving the model's performance and

capable enough to use in the real estate.

Solution:

The research interests in this project include advanced machine learning models for real estate price

prediction, novel feature engineering techniques, deep learning algorithms for market trend analysis, and

the impact of external factors on real estate prices. The expected outcomes of this research are improved

accuracy in predicting real estate prices, enhanced understanding of factors influencing prices, automated

valuation models for financial institutions, and comprehensive market analysis tools for real estate

professionals and policymakers. These research interests aim to drive informed decision-making,

facilitate strategic investments, streamline property appraisal processes, and provide valuable insights into

the dynamics of real estate markets.

Dataset:

Dataset has 13,320 rows and 9 columns. This dataset is from Kaggle created by amitabhajoy.

IMPLEMENTATION:

This research makes use of jupyter IDE. It is an open-source web app that helps us to share as well create

documents which have live code, visualizations, equations and text that narrates. It contains tools for data

cleaning, transformation of data. Simulation of numeric values, modelling using statistics, visualization of

data and machine learning tools. Here we collected house sales related data to estimate the house prices

based on real world dataset. It is a public output dataset of that specified region in India. All the above

mentioned regression techniques are implemented using the above specified tools. In order to find out the

efficient regression technique for prediction, we require certain parameters to perform comparison among

the techniques. The parameters chosen for the comparison are Scores of the algorithm, [MSE] Mean

Square Error and [RMSE] Root Mean Square Error. The below Table 1 represents the resultant summary

of the parameters, when above techniques are implemented practically.

From the above table, we can easily perform comparison of different algorithms clearly to find the best

among them. We can say that linear regression is having highest score so, I thought it will be better to use

this model in the prediction.

Plot same scatter chart again to visualize price\_per\_sqft for 2 BHK and 3 BHK properties

Model Evaluation:

The models' performances were evaluated using metrics such as R-squared and mean squared error. These

evaluations shed light on the effectiveness of each model in capturing the variance in home prices.

Performed Gridsearchcv function that evaluates the performance of different regression models using

hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation. It aims to find the best-performing model among Linear

Regression, Lasso Regression, and Decision Tree Regression for predicting house prices based on

provided features and target values.

Results:

The above are some predicted prices of houses in some areas where the price is in Indian rupees in lakhs.

Conclusion:

This article mainly concentrates on the comparison between different machine learning algorithms

(Multiple Linear Regression, LASSO Regression, gradient boosting) about House price prediction

Analysis. From the above experiment results, Linear regression algorithm has high accuracy value when

compared to all the other algorithms regarding house price predictions. The paper can be extended by

applying the above said algorithms to predict House resale value.

Future Work:

Further exploration could involve incorporating more advanced regression algorithms or exploring

additional datasets to enhance the predictive accuracy of the models. Deployment of this model building

into an application or a web server will be a good idea.
